# DisGUVered - an MaskRCNN for GUV micrscopy image analysis

DisGUVered is a MaskRCNN model capable of predicting GUVs, lipid aggregates and oil droplets in microscopy images. This repo includes the code for training, image generation and eval.

**Note:** The models are not in the repo as they are too large

## Usage
All codes are stored in notebooks for ease of use. train.ipynb contains the code for training, img_gen.ipynb for image generation and eval.ipynb for eval and basic analysis of size distrubution. Example images are also stored and images for GUVs, lipid aggregates and oil droplets are also avaliable for semi-synthetic image generation.
